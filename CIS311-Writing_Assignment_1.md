**<center>Difference Between Data and Information</center>**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the fact that I have pretty much exclusively used the words 'data' and 'information' interchangeably, learning that the words are different is eye opening to me. Before going into the differences I will define both words first from the "Merriam-Webster dictionary. 

    Data - noun.
    1: factual information (such as measurements or statistics) used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation
    2: information in digital form that can be transmitted or processed
    3: information output by a sensing device or organ that includes both useful and irrelevant or redundant information and must be processed to be meaningful

    Information - noun.
    1: knowledge obtained from investigation, study, or instruction
    2: the communication or reception of knowledge or intelligence
    3: the act of informing against a person
    4: a formal accusation of a crime made by a prosecuting officer as distinguished from an indictment presented by a grand jury

**<center>Decision Making</center>**

**<center>Impact of "The Cloud"</center>**
