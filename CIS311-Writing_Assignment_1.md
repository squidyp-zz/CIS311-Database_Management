Why it is Important to Stay Relevant

Keeping up-to-date with advances in any field is important. From an economical perspective, staying relevant ensures that the an individual will be employable. Technology changes in almost every field, we need to stay on top of the changes.

This is even more important in the technology field. In the late 1980's early 1990's the high of technology was the personal computer. Probably the main reason for this was the drop in the price of computing tech and the internet. In 1993 about 10% of United States households had a connection to the internet. By the year 2005 the adoption of the internet increased to 61% in the home, in 12 years the adoption increased 51%. Doesn't sound like a lot until you compare it to a common technology from the early part of the century, the automobile (Desjardins, 2018). 

The technology that enables us to go from Seattle, WA to San Diego, CA in about 22 hours took 36 years to make the same percentage just the internet did in 12. When we look at a technology that almost all of us use today, the smartphone, the numbers are even more staggering. In 2011, 35% of households had a smartphone. By 2019, the percentage justed to 81% (Desjardins, 2018). 

My point is that technology advances at an astounding rate across the board. But today technology is speeding up. The need to stay relevant is more important then ever in history. It maybe to the point where technology maybe out pacing our ability to keep up. 

DBMS to Stay Current

A database management system, or DBMS, is a collection of applications that are used to manage database structure and control access to a store data system. A DBMS sits in between the user and data and acts as an intermediary, it's the only way a user can access data in a database. DBMS' can be written in early any programming language, ensuring that the concept is used nearly everywhere that a database exists (Cornel & Morris, 2017). 

The flexibly of a DBMS to be written in a lot of languages lends the concept being able to be updated as new technologies come into existence. The added advantages of improved data sharing, security, and integration are also advances as technology advances.

Difference Between Data and Information

Considering the fact that I have pretty much exclusively used the words 'data' and 'information' interchangeably, learning that the words are different is eye opening to me. Before going into the differences I will define both words first from the "Merriam-Webster dictionary. 

    Data - noun.
    2: information in digital form that can be transmitted or processed

    Information - noun.
    1: knowledge obtained from investigation, study, or instruction

Essentially data is raw, unorganized, unfiltered, uninterrupted material that information can be derived from once analyzed. Data is facts, statistics, features, images, symbols, numbers and a plethora of other points that can be grouped together for analysis. Data is also a set of variables both qualitative and quantitative that can be put together for an outcome. Data also stands on its own. It does not depend on other pieces of data to exist (Svitla Team, 2019). Data enables us to communicate, but without information that communication would be for not. 

Information is dependent on pieces of data to exist. Information is the result of data once it is organized, analyzed, and/or interrupted. It is the decisions that we make based on data. It is the reports that we write because of research. It is the words we put together to write a college paper. Information allows for effective communication. It is the meaning of the data.


Anomalies - What, How and Impact

An anomaly is something that is abnormal. In data science an anomaly is essentially when data is not what it is supposed to be. This could be due to incomplete changes or updates to data, or maybe a power spike leading to bit flipping, or it could be as simple as removing data that a system or other data was dependent on. Either way it is quite simple to introduce anomalies into a system(Cornel & Morris, 2017). 

Avoiding an anomaly can be simple as well. One of the great things about a proper DBMS is that it checks for anomalies in the data. A DBMS could be programed to validate data to ensure it's in the correct format, it can also check for missing fields of data, and in the worst case scenario, such as a lost of data, a redundancy of data can be put into place to minimize or eliminate the lost. 

Decision Making

Decision-making is a fundamental part of who we are as humans. Making rational, informed decisions is what separates us from the majority of the other forms of life on this planet. Information is integral to that process. Without information we are not able to distinguish our decisions from those of an instinctual animal. Safe guarding data and information is the main function of a database. It is our job to ensure it can do its job.

Impact of "The Cloud"

Cloud technologies have impacted us on many levels. From social media with its constant stimulation, to video conferencing software that has enable the continuing of education and business during these uncertain times, cloud software has change our modern life. Gone are the days of having to by a Windows PC because it can run the same word processor you have at work. Gone are the days of not being able to access you family photos because they are at home on a book shelf. Gone are the days of having to go into the office for administrative work. 
    
The Cloud has simply enabled us but with that enabling has brought its own challenges. Criminals can steal personal information without having to even talk to the victim. Corporations can track their employees on and off the job. Big tech companies can sell your private information legally. Our lives are change, not for the better or for the worst, just changed.
