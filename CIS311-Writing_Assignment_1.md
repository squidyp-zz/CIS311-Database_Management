**<center>Difference Between Data and Information</center>**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the fact that I have pretty much exclusively used the words 'data' and 'information' interchangeably, learning that the words are different is eye opening to me. Before going into the differences I will define both words first from the "Merriam-Webster dictionary. 

    Data - noun.
    2: information in digital form that can be transmitted or processed

    Information - noun.
    1: knowledge obtained from investigation, study, or instruction

**<center>Anomalies</center>**

**<center>Decision Making</center>**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**<center>Impact of "The Cloud"</center>**
