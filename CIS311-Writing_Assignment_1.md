The Information Age

Why it is Important to Stay Relevant

Keeping up-to-date with advances in any field is important. From an economical perspective, staying relevant ensures that the an individual will be employable. Technology changes in almost every field, we need to stay on top of the changes.

This is even more important in the technology field. In the late 1980's early 1990's the high of technology was the personal computer. Probably the main reason for this was the drop in the price of computing tech and the internet. In 1993 about 10% of United States households had a connection to the internet. By the year 2005 the adoption of the internet increased to 61% in the home, in 12 years the adoption increased 51%. Doesn't sound like a lot until you compare it to a common technology from the early part of the century, the automobile (Desjardins, 2018). 

The technology that enables us to go from Seattle, WA to San Diego, CA in about 22 hours took 36 years to make the same percentage just the internet did in 12. When we look at a technology that almost all of us use today, the smartphone, the numbers are even more staggering. In 2011, 35% of households had a smartphone. By 2019, the percentage justed to 81% (Desjardins, 2018). 

My point is that technology advances at an astounding rate across the board. But today technology is speeding up. The need to stay relevant is more important then ever in history. It maybe to the point where technology maybe out pacing our ability to keep up. 

DBMS to Stay Current

A database management system, or DBMS, is a collection of applications that are used to manage database structure and control access to a store data system. DBMS sits in between the user and data and acts as an intermediary, it's the only way a user can access data in a database. 


Difference Between Data and Information

Considering the fact that I have pretty much exclusively used the words 'data' and 'information' interchangeably, learning that the words are different is eye opening to me. Before going into the differences I will define both words first from the "Merriam-Webster dictionary. 

    Data - noun.
    2: information in digital form that can be transmitted or processed

    Information - noun.
    1: knowledge obtained from investigation, study, or instruction

Anomalies




Decision Making



Impact of "The Cloud"
